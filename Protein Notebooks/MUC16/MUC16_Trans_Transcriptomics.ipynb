    "MCM2 showed significantly altered transcriptomics when MUC16 was mutated in Endometrial cancer. It is a known interacting partner to MUC16. IGBP1 showed significantly altered transcriptomics when MUC16 was mutated in Colon cancer. It is also a known interacting partner to MUC16. NUP188, SFXN, SLC37A4, PSMB6, and UQCRC1 also all showed significantly altered transcriptomics when MUC17 was mutated in Endometrial cancer. TYMS, PXMP4, and ERGIC3 also all showed significantly altered transcriptomics when MUC17 was mutated in Colon Cancer."
